From your experiences (as per the proposals), we do gauge that most of you have a fair idea of ML, but have little to no experience in DL & NLP. So, we will utilize this first week to ramp up on those aspects & get started with the basics of Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing. We would also like you to get acquainted with Tensorflow and Pytorch. Resources for the same are mentioned below:

 - Visual Interactive Guide: Basics of NNs
https://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/
 - Basics of Neural Networks
https://becominghuman.ai/basics-of-neural-network-bef2ba97d2cf
 - Loss function overview and implementation

 - Introduction to NLP

 - Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python â€” Tutorial

Feel free to dive into any other resources & tutorials available.

Side Resources (for brushing up on pre-requisite knowledge so that everyone comes on the same page) 

Since some of you are not very well versed with Python, here are few links to learn some basic python libraries - 

Numpy: https://realpython.com/numpy-tutorial/
Pandas: https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/
Matplotlib: https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/

Feel free to check out the documentations of these libraries for any functionality that u want to achieve...they contain detailed description of functions, their parameters, example usage, etc.  Documentations may initially sound or look boring, but in d long run they gotta be your best friends!!   

Also...do leverage https://stackoverflow.com/ for doubts that u may have. Coz almost any doubt that u have, someone else may have had it earlier & someone would have helped him/her out on this platform.

For a quick primer on ML (with some hands on stuff as well, without delving very deep into the maths), here's a short crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2q5OFtxm6A
It will give u a quick overview about types of ML problems & a plethora of ML algorithms.

For those who don't know, Git and GitHub help you to collaborate on your code with your fellow teammates and keep a track of all the changes done in the files. To get a brief idea, you can watch this 4 min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI
There will be a session organised by WnCC later on the same so we are not providing resources right now.

Let us know if you want more resources on any topic (although we advise that you search them yourself first).
